Vanilla Implementation of: Bidirectional Multi-Constrained Routing Algorithms
==================================================== 


**Abstract:** QoS routing plays a critical role in providing QoS support in the Internet. Most existing QoS routing algorithms employ the strategy of unidirectional search in route selection. Bidirectional search has been recognized as an effective strategy for fast route acquisition in identifying the shortest path connecting a pair of nodes. However, its efficiency has not been well established in the context of route selection subject to multiple additive constraints, which is in generalNP-Complete. In this paper, authors study how to employ bidirectional search to support efficient QoS routing subject to multiple additive constraints. Authors propose a shortest path algorithm using bidirectional search, a novel cost-effective bidirectional multiconstrained routing algorithm, which can greatly alleviate the forwarding state scalability issue by supporting stateless QoS routing in IP networks via IP tunneling or constraints-based alternate routing inMPLSnetworks via label stacks. It has the fastest known on-line running time.
